## Introduction

Ever found a suspicious file, like a keygen, and worried about running it?  This post shows how to create a safe, isolated environment using a lightweight Windows 8.1 virtual machine within VirtualBox. We'll walk through downloading a tiny Windows 8.1 ISO, installing it in VirtualBox, and setting up shared folders to transfer files.  This allows you to test potentially malicious software without risking your main operating system.  The VM uses minimal resources (around 2GB of disk space and 200MB of RAM), making it ideal for quick tests.
